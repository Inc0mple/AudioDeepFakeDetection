# CNN Speech Classification Implementation

This folder contains a custom implementation of the architecture described in this paper: ["Hello? Who Am I Talking to?" A Shallow CNN Approach for Human vs. Bot Speech Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682743).

The datasets used are the same datasets used for the rest of this project, which consist of:

- Human Voice Dataset: [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
- Synthetic Voice Dataset: [WaveFake](https://zenodo.org/record/5642694)

If you have any concerns or queries, feel free to direct them to [James Raphael Tiovalen](https://github.com/jamestiotio).
